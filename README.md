# Chat-2.0
The WebSocket Chat v2 project is an enhanced version of the web-based chat application, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages WebSocket technology to enable real-time communication between the client and the server. Users can enter their username, send and receive messages, view the list of connected users, and receive typing indicators.

Key Features:

    Real-time chat functionality with WebSocket communication
    Ability to set and display the user's username
    Sending and receiving messages, including private messages
    Automatic display of connected user list
    Typing indicators to show when a user is typing
    Sanitization of user input to prevent injection attacks
    Support for displaying clickable links, images, and videos in messages
    Notification support to receive alerts for new messages (if enabled by the user)

To use the chat application, simply enter your username, type your message in the input box, and press enter or click the send button to send a message. You can also send private messages by entering "/to <username> <message>" in the input box. The connected user list is displayed, allowing you to click on a username to initiate a private message.

The chat application provides a seamless and interactive experience, allowing real-time communication with other users. It also supports system messages, such as displaying connection status and disconnection notifications. The application ensures data security by sanitizing user input and preventing injection attacks.

Please note that this is an enhanced version of the basic chat application and can be further customized and extended to meet specific requirements.
