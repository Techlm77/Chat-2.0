Users can enter their username, send and receive messages, view the list of connected users, and receive typing indicators.

## Key Features

- Real-time chat functionality with WebSocket communication
- Ability to set and display the user's username
- Sending and receiving messages, including private messages

## Bidirectional Integration with Discord

The WebSocket Chat v2 project features bidirectional integration with Discord, enhancing the chat experience by bridging the gap between the web-based chat and a Discord server. The bidirectional integration includes:

- **Sending Messages to Discord:** Messages sent from the web-based chat are seamlessly forwarded to a specified Discord channel, allowing users to communicate with both chat and Discord members in real-time.

- **Receiving Messages from Discord:** Messages sent in the specified Discord channel are also displayed in the web-based chat, enabling a unified conversation experience.

## Usage

To use the chat application, simply enter your username, type your message in the input box, and press enter or click the send button to send a message. You can also send private messages by entering "/to <username> <message>" in the input box. The connected user list is displayed, allowing you to click on a username to initiate a private message.
